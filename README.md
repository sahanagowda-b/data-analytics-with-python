# Data Analytics with Python – NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This repository contains a beginner-friendly data analytics notebook developed while learning core Python data analysis libraries. The notebook demonstrates hands-on practice with **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, covering foundational concepts required for machine learning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

##  Project Overview
This notebook walks through essential data manipulation and visualization techniques, including:

- Numerical computing with **NumPy**
- Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis with **Pandas**
- Static visualizations using **Matplotlib**
- Statistical visualizations using **Seaborn**
- Real-world style exploratory analysis workflows

The purpose of this project is to build strong fundamentals in data analytics before moving into machine learning projects.

##  Technologies Used
